👋 Hi, I’m @Xiangru1227
I’m an Electrical Engineer at Automated Precision Inc., where I work on advanced metrology devices such as the iProbe and vProbe. My focus is on embedded systems, real-time computer vision, and GPU-accelerated optimization, with experience in C++, CUDA, and Python. I enjoy building reliable, high-performance software that bridges hardware and algorithms.

👀 I’m interested in …
Exploring the intersection of robotics, autonomy, and high-performance computing. I’m especially fascinated by problems that require real-time perception, system calibration, and precise hardware-software integration.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on …
Projects involving embedded software, vision pipelines, or robotics platforms, particularly those that push the boundaries of autonomous systems and intelligent sensing.

📫 How to reach me …
